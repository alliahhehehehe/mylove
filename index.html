           <p>My Dearest,</p> <br>
            <p>Happy 8th monthsary. From the very first spark, you’ve been my best friend, my lover, and the magic in my world. I still feel like we’re living in that dream where every glance, every laugh, and every touch makes me fall in love with you all over again. I’m so grateful for these eight months of gentle and genuine moments with you, and I can’t wait for all the adventures, giggles, and a life journey that are still to come. I love you so much, mahal ko. </p><br>
            <p>All and forever yours, <br> Alliah</p>
